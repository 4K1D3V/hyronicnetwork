**==Resource Management==**

### Plan for Resource Management in Hyronic

Effective resource management is crucial for player progression in Hyronic. This plan outlines how players will gather, store, and use resources such as gold, elixir, and dark elixir.

### Resource Types and Their Uses

1. **Gold**
   - **Uses**: Building and upgrading defensive structures, purchasing building plots.
   - **Collection Methods**: Gold mines, raiding other players' villages.

2. **Elixir**
   - **Uses**: Training troops, upgrading troops, building and upgrading non-defensive structures.
   - **Collection Methods**: Elixir collectors, raiding other players' villages.

3. **Dark Elixir**
   - **Uses**: Training and upgrading special troops (e.g., heroes), building specific advanced structures.
   - **Collection Methods**: Dark elixir drills, raiding high-level players' villages.

### Gathering Resources

#### **1. Resource Buildings**
- **Gold Mines**: Automatically generate gold over time. Players can upgrade these mines to increase production rates and storage capacity.
- **Elixir Collectors**: Automatically generate elixir over time. Upgrading these collectors increases their production rates and storage capacity.
- **Dark Elixir Drills**: Generate dark elixir over time. Upgrading drills increases production rates and storage capacity.

#### **2. Raiding Other Villages**
- **PvP Raids**: Players can raid other players' villages to steal a portion of their resources. Success in these raids depends on the strength of the attacking troops and the defenses of the target village.
- **NPC Raids**: Players can also raid NPC villages, which provide resources without the risk of retaliation.

#### **3. Quests and Challenges**
- **Daily Quests**: Completing daily quests rewards players with resources.
- **Special Challenges**: Periodic challenges and events offer resources as rewards for completion.

### Storing Resources

#### **1. Resource Storage Buildings**
- **Gold Storage**: Allows players to store larger quantities of gold. Upgrading gold storage increases capacity.
- **Elixir Storage**: Allows players to store larger quantities of elixir. Upgrading elixir storage increases capacity.
- **Dark Elixir Storage**: Allows players to store larger quantities of dark elixir. Upgrading dark elixir storage increases capacity.

#### **2. Protected Storage**
- **Safety Mechanisms**: A percentage of a player's resources is protected from being stolen during raids. This can be enhanced through building upgrades or special items.

### Using Resources

#### **1. Building and Upgrading Structures**
- **Defensive Structures**: Use gold to build and upgrade defenses such as cannons, archer towers, and walls.
- **Non-Defensive Structures**: Use elixir to build and upgrade structures like barracks and army camps.
- **Special Structures**: Use dark elixir for advanced buildings and special upgrades.

#### **2. Training and Upgrading Troops**
- **Basic Troops**: Use elixir to train and upgrade basic troops such as barbarians and archers.
- **Special Troops**: Use dark elixir to train and upgrade special troops like heroes and dark troops.

#### **3. Purchasing Items and Enhancements**
- **Shops and Marketplaces**: Players can spend resources in in-game shops to buy items, decorations, and enhancements.
- **Trade System**: Implement a trading system where players can exchange resources or items with others.

### Balancing Resource Flow

#### **1. Production vs. Consumption**
- **Balanced Generation**: Ensure that resource generation rates (mines, collectors, drills) are balanced with the consumption rates (building, upgrading, training).
- **Upgrade Costs**: Adjust costs for upgrades and training to create a steady progression curve.

#### **2. Raid Rewards and Penalties**
- **Reward Balance**: Balance the rewards from raiding to ensure it is profitable but not overwhelmingly advantageous.
- **Loss Mitigation**: Implement mechanisms to protect new players and prevent excessive losses during raids.

#### **3. Event-Based Adjustments**
- **Seasonal Events**: Introduce seasonal events that temporarily boost resource generation or offer unique rewards.
- **Limited-Time Offers**: Periodically offer limited-time deals or resource boosts to encourage player engagement.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Develop Resource Buildings**
   - Create plugins or use existing ones to manage resource generation and storage buildings.
   - Implement upgrade paths and visual indicators for resource buildings.

2. **Design and Balance Raiding Mechanics**
   - Develop raid mechanics to handle PvP and NPC village raids.
   - Balance resource theft rates and defensive mechanisms.

3. **Integrate Quests and Challenges**
   - Implement a quest system that rewards resources for completing tasks.
   - Design special challenges and events with resource rewards.

4. **Set Up Storage Systems**
   - Create storage buildings with upgrade paths.
   - Implement protected storage mechanics.

5. **Resource Economy Balancing**
   - Regularly monitor and adjust resource generation and consumption rates.
   - Use player feedback and analytics to fine-tune the economy.
